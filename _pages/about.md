I am currently an undergraduate student in [Yao Class, IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/). Now, I am also a research intern at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/).

Research interest
======
I am broadly interested in research on robotics, imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Now the topic I most want to study is how to bring common sense to embodied agents.

Maybe one day there will be a robot that can do research and report progress to my advisor for me, and my advisor will not even be able to notice it!

Miscellaneous
======
In my spare time, I like playing soccer, watching anime, and playing video games with wonderful music and immersive stories. I am also an amateur game developer using Unity and RPG Maker. Coding awesome and structured projects gracefully can make me feel very good.

Randomly generated ideas
======
1. It is well known that compared to simple creatures, we humans have both cerebellum and cerebrum, which give us extraordinary movement abilities. Does this phenomenon of humans result from that humans have a sufficiently good structure, so embodied agents can also achieve it by good enough inductive bias, or just result from that humans have collected countless years of data, so scale is all you need for AGI?
2. Maybe we could combine souls-like game with audio game, to give people a better boss experience?
3. If we could define intelligence concretely, could humans theoretically create agents smarter than themselves?
